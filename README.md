## Welcome to the MXNet/Gluon Tutorial

MXNet is widely used in production environments owing to its strong reputation for speed. Now with `gluon`, MXNetâ€™s new imperative interface, doing research in MXNet is easy.

In this tutorial, we will walk through how to use `gluon` to implement algorithms ranging from basic linear regression to object detection. We will present every concept in details, no deep learning background is required to attend. We encourage the audience to bring their laptops to have a hands-on experience with `gluon`. 

The schedule of this tutorial is as follows:

1. **9:00 - 9:30:** Introduction to MXNet and Gluon
2. **9:30 - 10:30:** Part I: n-dimensional arrays, auto differentiation, linear regression  and convolution neural network
3. **10:30 - 11:00:** Coffee break
4. **11:00 - 12:00:** Part II: residual networks, single shot multibox detector, and multi-gpu/machine training.
